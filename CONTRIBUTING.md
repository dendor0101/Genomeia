# Contributing

Warning: the code right now is not very good / pretty messy,
but if you manage to figure it out, feel free to release mods.

Mod release rules:
Create a separate branch
Write your code
Push it
Open a pull request
Build it (Android → .apk, Windows → .jar)
Share it with the community: include a description of what you changed, the build file, and a link to your pull request

Right now I'm working on refactoring the project to improve its stability and readability.
I hope that in the future the code will become much better and cleaner, and it will be significantly easier for everyone to work with it.
